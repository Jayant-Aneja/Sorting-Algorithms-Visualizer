# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer
Visualization of some popular sorting algorithms using open-GL framework.
# ABOUT SORTING
Sorting a sequence of items is one of the pillar of Computer Science. A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that organizes elements of a sequence in a certain order. Since the early days of computing, the sorting problem has been one of the main battlefields for researchers. The reason behind this is not only the need of solving a very common task but also the challenge of solving a complex problem in the most efficient way.

This project is an attempt to visualize and help to understand how some of the most famous sorting algorithms work. This project provides two standpoints to look at algorithms, one is more artistic (apologies to any real artist out there), the other is more analytical aiming at explaining algorithm step by step.

This project does not want to teach the theory of sorting algorithms, there are amazing resources, books and courses for this purpose. Sorting Visualizer program is for the ones who want to see these algorithms under a different light and theme and hopefully appreciate the processing and brain power behind these piece of genius that in many ways have changed the way we live.

# Features
Provides random theme for every run
Two modes for interaction
Keyboard interface
About Mode
Interactive Mode
Using this mode you can watch each swap of variables with interaction. Press s to go to next swap.

# Outstanding Mode
This mode will run the selected algorithm with predefined constant speed.

# Menu
To start the sorting press s
To pause the soritng press p
To randamize the inputs press r
To change\select the algorithm press c
To set interactive mode press i
To set outstanding mode press o
To set new random color pressz which also randomize the inputs
Press <ESC> key to terminate the application
